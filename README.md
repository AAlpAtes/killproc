# killproc
Kill processes using multiple filters and wildcards. (For Windows only)

For ease of use, you can copy the killproc.exe to "C:\Windows\System32" folder so it will allow you to run it from any path in command prompt.

Usage: Just run the executable with the filters seperated by space. You can use "*" or "?" as wildcard. It is case insensitive. Do not forget to "Run as Administrator"

killproc filter1 [filter2] [filter3]...

Ex: killproc notepad* *paint
